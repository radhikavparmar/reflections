How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff -u command had ++ and --
diff command had only short lines mentioned

Bug was easily noticed in the "changed area"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
